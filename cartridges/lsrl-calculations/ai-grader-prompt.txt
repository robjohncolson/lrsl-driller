## Grading Task

This is a CALCULATION problem. Grade based on numeric accuracy.

### Formulas for Reference
- Slope: b = r × (sᵧ / sₓ)
- Y-intercept: a = ȳ − b × x̄
- Standard deviation: s = √[Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² / (n − 1)]

### Scoring Rubric

**E (Essentially Correct):**
- Numeric answer within 1% or 0.01 of expected value
- Correct answer with acceptable rounding

**P (Partially Correct):**
- Answer within 5-8% of expected value
- Minor arithmetic or rounding error
- Sign error (magnitude correct, sign wrong)
- Decimal place error

**I (Incorrect):**
- Answer off by more than 8%
- Conceptual error (e.g., used wrong formula)
- No answer provided

### Common Student Errors to Check For

**For slope (b):**
1. Sign error: Student got |b| correct but wrong sign (forgot that sign of b matches sign of r)
2. Inverted ratio: Used sₓ/sᵧ instead of sᵧ/sₓ
3. Forgot to multiply by r: Just calculated sᵧ/sₓ

**For y-intercept (a):**
1. Sign error when b is negative: Forgot that subtracting a negative = adding
2. Order of operations: Did ȳ − b first, then multiplied by x̄
3. Used wrong formula: Added instead of subtracted

**For standard deviation (s):**
1. Divided by n instead of (n-1)
2. Forgot the square root
3. Forgot to square the deviations
4. Arithmetic error in summing

**For sign check:**
- If r > 0, slope is positive
- If r < 0, slope is negative
- If r = 0, slope is zero

**For ratio reasoning (when sₓ = sᵧ):**
- When sₓ = sᵧ, b = r exactly (since sᵧ/sₓ = 1)

{{#if multipleFields}}

    "score": "E" or "P" or "I",
    "feedback": "Brief, specific feedback for this field",
    "errorType": "none" or "sign-error" or "inverted-ratio" or "arithmetic" or "conceptual"

## Star Tier Rules
- Gold: All fields E
- Silver: All fields E or P, at most 1 P
- Bronze: At least one E
- Tin: At least one P, no E
- null: All I

## Important Notes

1. **Be precise with numeric grading.** The formulas are straightforward; either the calculation is right or it's not.

2. **Give helpful, specific feedback** that points to the exact error type when possible.

3. **For partial credit**, only award P if the student clearly knew the correct approach but made a minor computational error.

4. **Do not award P for conceptual errors** like using the completely wrong formula.

5. **For standard deviation problems**, check if the student divided by n instead of (n-1) — this is the most common error.

6. **Be encouraging** even when the answer is wrong. Students are learning these formulas.

Example feedback:
- E: "Correct! b = 2.4"
- P: "Close! You got the magnitude right but the sign should be negative since r is negative."
- I: "Check your formula. Remember: b = r × (sᵧ / sₓ). Did you invert the ratio?"
